# Comparison Based Sorting Algorithms

This project basically runs each sorting algorithms for three types of cases: Random Array, Sorted Array, Reversely Sorted Array.

Sorting algorithms which implemented are:

  - Insertion Sort (sorting for small numbers)
  - Merger Sort (divide and conquer)
  - In-place Quick sort (pivot partition)
  - Modified Quick Sort (Use medians for partitions)
  - Heap Sort (Binary Heap) 

All of the above algorithms run with the number of elements 1000, 2000, 4000, 5000, 10000, 20000, 300000, 40000, 50000 and measure the run time.

Comparison made for each three cases with all different inputs to check which algorithms runs in a better time.
